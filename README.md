# TemplateProject

Please install **cookiecutter** in order to retrieve the template:
```bash
	pip install cookiecutter --user
```

##### If your work on Windows:
Ensure the directory where cookiecutter will be installed is in your environment’s *Path* in order to make it possible to invoke it from a command prompt. To do so, search for “Modifier les variables d'environnement systeme” on your computer, click on "Variables d'environnement"  and add that directory to the Path environment variable, using the GUI to edit path segments.

Example segments should look like *%APPDATA%\Python\Python3x\Scripts*, where you have your version of Python instead of Python3x.

You may need to restart your command prompt session to load the environment variables.


#### Retrieve the template

Use the following command:
```bash
	cookiecutter https://github.com/CREM-projects/Template-Project.git
```
